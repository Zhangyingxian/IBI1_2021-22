In the week 4, I get 100 percent. So I didn't change anything.
In the week 5, "W should be true only if both X and Y are True" X and Y should be booleans. But in my portfolio, they were string, so I change X and Y to booleans.
In the week 5, I didn't write enough pseudocode. So now I add I added detailed pseudocode in my portfolio.
In the week 6,"Displays frequency table that matches the input when the input table is changed" I didn't display this. So I add an input which can be displayed.
In the week 6,"Displays a well-labelled scatter plot" So I add labels to show the plot more clearly.
